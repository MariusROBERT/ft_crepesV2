# FT_CRÃŠPES

You like crepes ? Crepes are cool.

---

This project is made to host ft_crepes' musics,
you will be able to listen to them online once the website is finished.

Its an upgrade of the [old website](https://github.com/MariusROBERT/ft_crepes) which was made in vanilla JS
in less than an hour, this one is made with React and [Mantine](http://mantine.dev).

Feel free to explore the code and improve it.
Keep in mind that it's not meant to be an extraordinary website with a lot of content and animations everywhere
but just a simple way to listen to a few music made by passionate students.
